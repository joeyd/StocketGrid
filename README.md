===========

##A WordPress Baseline Theme w/ LESS.

A personal theme... And also a work in progress...

Because every project is different. The theme is bare-bones with boiler plate.

### Features

* Contains common WordPress Classes/IDs - /less/wordpress.less
* Use the included  grid system (semantic.gs) or toss in your own - /less/grid.less
* Support for devices icons/tiles. (iOS Icons and Windows Tiles) - /device-support/
* Font-Awesome ready
* Friendly IE8 and below end user messaging - /incs/html-header.php

### Setup (work in progress...)

* Install theme by using WP or FTP and activate.
* Workflow: I use Sublime Text and Codekit for LESS compiling. Make sure to have /less/style.less compile to /style.css (root of the theme)
* If you are not using Woocommerce, you can remove woocommerce.php from the root theme directory.
* Style.less contains imports of other less files. Add/remove as needed.
* Change favicon/device icons to fit your project needs. They are located in /device-support.
